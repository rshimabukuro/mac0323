 *  Explain briefly how you implemented the randomized queue and deque.
 *  Which data structure did you choose (array, linked list, etc.)
 *  and why?
 *****************************************************************************/
In RandomizedQueue I used a linked list, so it's easier to add a cell and there's
no need resize, enqueue adds a cell to the beginning of the list and dequeue
sorts a  random number (0~N) then goes to that position(using pointers) and
deletes the equivalent cell.

In Deque I used a doubly linked list with pointers to the first and last 
positions, so adding and removing from the end or beginning are very efficient 
operations that cost constant time.

 *  How much memory (in bytes) do your data types use to store N items
 *  in the worst case? Use the 64-bit memory cost model from Section
 *  1.4 of the textbook and use tilde notation to simplify your answer.
 *  Briefly justify your answers and show your work.
 *
 *  Do not include the memory for the items themselves (as this
 *  memory is allocated by the client and depends on the item type)
 *  or for any iterators, but do include the memory for the references
 *  to the items (in the underlying array or linked list).
 *****************************************************************************/

Randomized Queue:   ~   40*N bytes

Deque:              ~   48*N bytes
